Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn to use SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA to develop both HDI (SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure) and XSA (SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model) based applications.\r\n\r\n## Course Summary\r\nWith the delivery of SAP HANA SPS 11, we see a large number of new features in both the underlying SAP HANA infrastructure and in particular in the custom development aspects of SAP HANA native development.\r\n\r\nRequirements change over time, and so too has XS within SAP HANA. SAP HANA extended application services in SPS 11 represents an evolution of the application server architecture, building upon the previous strengths while expanding the technical scope. This course will offer an overview of the new architecture and the various expanded capabilities it makes possible.\r\n\r\nAll of the architectural changes described in this course can be summarized in one key point: Choice. SAP HANA SPS 11 and higher offers customers and partners the freedom of choice of technologies, tools, and deployment options for high-scale development and operation of native SAP HANA applications.\r\n\r\nIt is also easier to choose between on-premise and cloud deployment. Because of the shared architecture being delivered going forward, it will soon be easy to develop an application that can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or in both scenarios without any coding changes.\r\n\r\nIn this course, weâ€™ll assume that you have baseline knowledge of SAP HANA development and will instead focus on the new and improved features that were introduced in SAP HANA SPS 11 and 12. Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn to use SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA to develop both HDI (SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure) and XSA (SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model) based applications.\r\n\r\n## Course Characteristics\r\nStarting from: November 2, 2016, 09:00 UTC. (What does this mean?)\r\nDuration: 5 weeks (3 - 4 hours per week)\r\nFinal exam: December 7-15, 2016\r\nCourse language: English\r\nHow is an openSAP course structured?\r\n\r\n## Course Content\r\nWeek 1: Introduction\r\nWeek 2: Database Development\r\nWeek 3: Application Server and UI Development\r\nWeek 4: Node.js\r\nWeek 5: Wrap-Up\r\nWeek 6: Final Exam\r\n\r\n## Target Audience\r\nApplication developers\r\nSAP HANA developers\r\nHCP developers\r\nCourse Requirements\r\nBasic programming knowledge including HTML, JavaScript, and SQL\r\nBaseline SAP HANA development knowledge from one of the previous openSAP HANA courses would be helpful\r\n\r\n## How to import code to SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA?\r\n\r\nThe code can be imported to SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA version SP12 and up. \r\n\r\n- Launch SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA\r\n\r\n\r\n- Navigate to File->Git->Clone repository\r\n\r\n\r\n- Enter the URL of the repository [https://github.com/SAP/com.sap.openSAP.hana5.templates](https://github.com/SAP/com.sap.openSAP.hana5.templates \"https://github.com/SAP/com.sap.openSAP.hana5.templates\") \r\n- Click Ok button\r\n\r\n",

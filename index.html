<p>In this course, we will focus on the new and improved features that were introduced in SAP HANA SPS 11 and 12. Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn to use SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA to develop both HDI (SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure) and XSA (SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model) based applications.</p>

<a id="course-summary" class="anchor" href="#course-summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Summary</h2>

<p>With the delivery of SAP HANA SPS 11, we see a large number of new features in both the underlying SAP HANA infrastructure and in particular in the custom development aspects of SAP HANA native development.</p>

<p>Requirements change over time, and so too has XS within SAP HANA. SAP HANA extended application services in SPS 11 represents an evolution of the application server architecture, building upon the previous strengths while expanding the technical scope. This course will offer an overview of the new architecture and the various expanded capabilities it makes possible.</p>

<p>All of the architectural changes described in this course can be summarized in one key point: Choice. SAP HANA SPS 11 and higher offers customers and partners the freedom of choice of technologies, tools, and deployment options for high-scale development and operation of native SAP HANA applications.</p>

<p>It is also easier to choose between on-premise and cloud deployment. Because of the shared architecture being delivered going forward, it will soon be easy to develop an application that can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or in both scenarios without any coding changes.</p>

<p>In this course, weâ€™ll assume that you have baseline knowledge of SAP HANA development and will instead focus on the new and improved features that were introduced in SAP HANA SPS 11 and 12. Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn to use SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA to develop both HDI (SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure) and XSA (SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model) based applications.</p>
